```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
source("code/gapminder_utilities.R")
```

This is an initial report describing changes in life expectancy over the past 60 years as it relates to GDP, country, and continent.  These data were taken from the gapminder dataset. 

```{r load_data, echo=FALSE} 
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
```

The gapminder dataset contains `r ncol(gapminder)` variables from `r nrow(gapminder)` observations. Blah blah blah.  Enter stuff about the data in the graph below.

```{r facet_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width= 8, fig.path= "figures/"}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(. ~continent)
```


```{r gdp}
calcGDP(gapminder, country = "China")
head(calcGDP(gapminder, year = 2002))
calcGDP(gapminder, country = "China", year = 2002)
```

The "capstone" challenge is to make a faceted plot of GDP overtime, faceted by continent.  Here is how I'm gonna do this:

```{r GDPfacet_plot, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width= 8, fig.path= "figures/"}
newcol <- calcGDP(gapminder)
ggplot(data = newcol, aes(x = year, y = gdp, color = continent)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(. ~continent)
```

### Here, Have A Heading

Not sure whether students are wanted to be typing stuff right now.  Just in case, I am typing stuff. Here, I will make a list:

* words and stuff
* I am making a list
* This is the third item on the list. 
* *this will be italics, right?*

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
The average speed in our dataset was `r mean(cars$speed)` (sd= `r sd(cars$speed)`).

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
