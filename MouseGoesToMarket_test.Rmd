## Mouse Goes to Market:
*The adventures of a hungry young pup.*

Mouse is a hound dog.  She has an active sniffer.  She sniffs something yummy and now she is hungry. 

Mouse looks for a snack, but finds none.  She decides to go to the market!  What will her grocery list look like?

* Peanut butter
* Cat food
* More peanut butter
* **BEEF!**

Mouse buys her groceries.  The total of her expenses were (if this were for real there would be a back tick here) r sum(mousebill$price) (and another back tick here).
